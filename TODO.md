# TODO LIST

* Custom tracert command (with actual socket connection)
* Tkinter UI
* Turtle graphic display (or maybe something else depending on how we use it (i.e. a world map(maybe use [geopandas](https://medium.com/@kavee625/plotting-data-on-the-world-map-with-geopandas-f03742615196) library for it)))
* IP to address convertion (use free [ip-api API](https://ip-api.com/docs/api:json))
* main.py file to connect everything together in one piece
